This file contains some useful tricks for VIM

Motions:
-> a - all
-> i - in 
-> t - until 
-> f - find forward 
-> F - find backward 

Commands:
-> d - delete
-> c - change -> same as delete but it goes in insert mode after delete
-> y - yank
-> v - visually select

We can do following with these:
{commands}{motion}

For example:
	diw -> delete in word
	ct" -> change until "
	caw -> change all word
	ya" -> copy all inside " including "


Macros -> records a sequence of commands in a register
	q{register} ....do anything.... q
	Play a macro -> @{register}

Pipe commands to shell and get back the result into VIM:
	:%! -> % is for current file and ! is for run following in shell
	for example: :%!grep -v .....

Vertically select lines and delete:
	ctrl+v -> to go in visual block and use up down keys

Search -> /\.$ -> This will search for dot at the end of the line
	:%s// -> last searched thing if we don't provide anything here

Put vim on hold and go to shell -> :sh
